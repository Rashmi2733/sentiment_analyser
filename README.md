# Sentiment Analyser
A basic sentiment analyser summarizes top yelp reviews from given restauarnt location.

A basic Streamlit UI takes the restaurant name, location, and number of reviews to summarize and gives a dropdown list based on the name and location provided (this is based on the results given by SERP API.)

Once a location is chosen, we get the top reviews along with the sentiment for each and the counts of positive, negative, and neutral reviews (also gives the average ratings baded on selected reviews).
